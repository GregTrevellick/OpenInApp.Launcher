## Use Cases

The [Visual Studio IDE][VisualStudioURL] has an outstanding and feature-rich editor for a wide range of file types, even in the free "Community" editions, which can be overridden to open a third-party application.

That said, there may be times when you wish to edit a file in an alternative editor/application without overriding the default [Visual Studio][VisualStudioURL] editor, for example:-

- You only occasionally wish to use a specific alternative editor.

- You have overriden the default [Visual Studio][VisualStudioURL] editor to a particular application, but need easy IDE access to a second particular editor.

- Certain files (e.g. gigantic size files, or files with complex content) may be better suited in an alternative editor.

- Pair programming scenarios where each developer has different preferred editor.

- You are more familiar with a certain editor's features, or simply have a favourite editor.
